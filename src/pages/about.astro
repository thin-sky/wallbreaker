        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          When you shop with us, a portion of every sale goes directly to supporting 
          the causes associated with each product. We work closely with our partners 
          to ensure your contributions reach the right places and make the maximum impact.
        </p>

          Whether you're buying for yourself or as a gift, you can shop with confidence 
          knowing that your purchase is making a difference.
